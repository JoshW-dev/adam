# ADAM Project

The goal of this project is to create an artificially intelligent 
artist that creates digital paintings based on input and its internal state

## Note Entries
Tried using a discord bot and discord API with discord-py for communication with midjourney bot. Ran into some annoying restrictions with discord bot persmissions and adding it to the channel. Still don't even know if a discord bot can imagine like a real user can. ->Try exploring python clicker/typer bot instead

Clicker/typer bot seems to be working, test with instagram uploads


A 'personality' system can be used for just generating tags -> should be more simple to implement


The quote searching system needs rework., default to no quote unless certain criteria met


Sending in parallel
- idea: send all prompts immediately and upscale all as buttons are seen - testing this now


## MVP

App webscrapes news and generates an image daily. Hosted online (starting on github)
- midjourney for image generation from tags - done
- need python package for taking screenshot and clicking right area  - done
- react frontend
- python django backend
-   python library for webscrapping and condensing text to tags


## Initial working product
Twitter bot that automatically posts based on news content -> take news headline
- use as prompt to generate image
- use to generate related famous quote
- Add quote text to image
- use chatbot to generate captions
-
