# ADAM Project

The goal of this project is to create a artificially intelligent 
artist that creates digital paintings based on input and its internal state

## Notes
Tried using a discord bot and discord API with discord-py for communication with midjourney bot. Ran into some annoying restrictions with discord bot persmissions and adding it to the channel. Still don't even know if a discord bot can imagine like a real user can. ->Try exploring python clicker/typer bot instead


## MVP

App webscrapes news and generates an image daily. Hosted online (starting on github)
- midjourney for image generation from tags
- react frontend
- python django backend
-   python library for webscrapping and condensing text to tags



## todo
- create single imput commandline and output frontend
- connect to discord API
- text input will generate image
- image output is sent to front end

-create tag input system


## done
-skeleton react project with input field


## Future Ideas
